Testing

Generate an angular project with Yeoman
Generate a directive called Snippet
Put our snippet code in there, test it

Then start fleshing out our application - show what Yeoman has provided us
Talk about $routeProvider, how it works with ng-view. Mention $routeParams

Then put in some HTML slides, show transclusion
Then we have to hide some of the slides - do it using ids on the slide element, and a global currentSlide value
Show that changing the currentSlide value changes the visible slide
Add keyboard control - inject $document into the controller and bind key events to it
Test that the controller changes currentSlide
