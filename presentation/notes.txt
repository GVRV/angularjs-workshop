Testing

Generate an angular project with Yeoman
Generate a directive called Snippet
Put our snippet code in there, test it

Then start fleshing out our application - show what Yeoman has provided us by default.
Generate a Controller called Main.
Talk about $routeProvider, how it works with ng-view. Mention how there's no in-built support for transitions between states, but people are working on that.
Talk about how the Goodfilms app uses an outer structure that is totally fixed, with one main window with an ng-view on it.
Show using <script type='text/ng-template' id='/views/main.html'>

Then put in a HTML slide, show transclusion. Test that it works.
Add the ability to show/hide the slides based on a scope variable. Test that.

Add some more slides, demonstrate show/hiding working.
Add keyboard control - inject $document into the controller and bind key events to it.
Add controller tests.

Start an end-to-end test.
Copy the base testacular config to testacular.e2e.conf
rm -rf ~/.npm/testacular
sudo npm install -g testacular
kill yeoman server
yeoman build
cd dist
../test/vendor/web-server.js

testacular start testacular.e2e.conf
